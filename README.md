## 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 – My Solutions
Welcome to my solutions for Advent of Code 2024, an annual international programming challenge that runs every December.
The event features 25 daily puzzles (from December 1st to December 25th), each with increasing difficulty and requiring logical thinking, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

### 📜 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl.
Each day’s puzzle has two parts, where the second part is unlocked after completing the first.

This repository contains my Python implementations for each day.

### 🛠 Skills & Concepts Practiced
Problem-solving and logical reasoning
Python programming
Algorithms and data structures
Parsing and processing inputs
Optimization techniques
